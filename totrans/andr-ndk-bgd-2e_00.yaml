- en: Android NDK is all about injecting high performance and portable code into your
    mobile apps by exploiting the maximum speed of these mobile devices. Android NDK
    allows you to write fast code for intensive tasks and port existing code to Android
    and non-Android platforms. Alternatively, if you have an application with multiple
    lines of C code, using NDK can considerably reduce the project development process.
    This is one of the most efficient operating systems for multimedia and games.

- en: This Beginner's Guide will show you how to create applications enabled by C/C++
    and integrate them with Java. By using this practical step-by-step guide, and
    gradually practicing your new skills using the tutorials, tips, and tricks, you
    will learn how to run C/C++ code embedded in a Java application or in a standalone
    application.

- en: The books starts by teaching you how to access native API and port libraries
    used in some of the most successful Android applications. Next, you will move
    on to create a real native application project through the complete implementation
    of a native API and porting existing third-party libraries. As we progress through
    the chapters, you will gain a detailed understanding of rendering graphics and
    playing sound with OpenGL ES and OpenSL ES, which are becoming the new standard
    in mobility. Moving forward, you will learn how to access the keyboard and input
    peripherals, and read accelerometer or orientation sensors. Finally, you will
    dive into more advanced topics, such as RenderScript.

    This chapter also covers installing the Android Studio bundle, which contains
    both the Android Studio IDE and the Android SDK.'

    a Native Android Project*, discusses how to build our first sample application
    using command-line tools and how to deploy it on an Android device. We also create
    our first native Android projects using Eclipse and Android Studio.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Interfacing Java and C/C++ with JNI"), *Interfacing
    Java and C/C++ with JNI*, covers how to make Java communicate with C/C++. We also
    handle Java object references in native code using Global references, and we learn
    the differences of Local references. Finally, we raise and check Java exceptions
    in native code.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Calling Java Back from Native Code"), *Calling
    Java Back from Native Code*, calls Java code from native code with the JNI Reflection
    API. We also process bitmaps natively with the help of JNI and decode a video
    feed by hand.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Writing a Fully Native Application"), *Writing
    a Fully Native Application*, discusses creating `NativeActivity` that polls activity
    events to start or stop native code accordingly We also access the display window
    natively, such as a bitmap to display raw graphics. Finally, we retrieve time
    to make the application adapt to device speed using a monotonic clock.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Rendering Graphics with OpenGL ES"), *Rendering
    Graphics with OpenGL ES*, covers how to initialize an OpenGL ES context and bind
    it to an Android window. Then, we see how to turn `libpng` into a module and load
    a texture from a PNG asset.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Playing Sound with OpenSL ES"), *Playing
    Sound with OpenSL ES*, covers how to initialize OpenSL ES on Android. Then, we
    learn how to play background music from an encoded file and in-memory sounds with
    a sound buffer queue. Finally, we discover how to record and play a sound in a
    way that is thread-safe and non-blocking.'

    App Glue event loop.'

    predefined RenderScript with built-in Intrinsics, which is currently mainly dedicated
    to image processing.'
