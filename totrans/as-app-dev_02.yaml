- en: You just installed Android Studio and now you want to get familiar with its
    features. You want to understand the necessary fields when creating a project.
    You would like to know how to add an icon to your application and associate it
    on the project, and you are wondering how to create the main activity and which
    type of activity to choose. How can you achieve this using Android Studio?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of this chapter is to create a new project with the basic content it
    should start out with. We will use the Android Studio wizard to create the project
    and we will go through the project configuration fields. We will choose a launch
    icon for our application and we will go through the different kinds of activities
    available in the wizard to pick as the main activity for our project.

    the **Create custom launcher icon** option, a second step is added to the wizard,
    and if you check the **Create activity** option, two additional steps are added.
    Check both of them.

    Devices with a previous SDK will not be able to install your application. Try
    to reach a balance between supported devices and available features. If your application
    does not require a specific feature published in the newest SDKs, then you can
    select an older **API** (**Application Programming Interface**). The last dashboards
    published by Google about the platforms distribution show that 95.5 percent of
    the devices use Android 2.3 or superior. If you select Android 2.2, then the percentage
    rises to 98.5 percent. Official Android dashboards are available at [http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html).'

    to the device screen resolution when the application is executing. To ensure that
    the icon will be displayed properly in every device, check if the `XXHDPI` image
    is not pixelated.

- en: There are three options to create your application icon, an image, one of the
    provided cliparts, or a text. The most common is an image. You can select your
    own image file to create the icon and adjust some parameters such as its padding,
    its shape, or the background color. Choose the **Image** option and leave the
    default image and options as they are. Click on **Next**.

    the configuration fields. We chose the launch icon for our application and made
    sure that it's going to display properly with any resolution. We went through
