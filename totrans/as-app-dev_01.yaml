    You want to know the features available in this environment. You would like to
    make your own Android applications, and you want these applications to be available
    to other users on Google Play Store. Can you do this easily? How can you achieve
    this?

- en: This chapter will show you how to prepare your new Android Studio installation
    and how to take your first steps in the new environment. We'll begin by preparing
    the system for the installation and downloading the required files. We'll see
    the welcome screen that prompts when running Android Studio for the first time
    and we'll configure the Android **SDK** (**Software Development Kit**) properly
    so you have everything ready to create your first application.

- en: A prerequisite to start working with Android Studio is to have Java installed
    in your system. The system also must be able to find the Java installation. This
    can be achieved by setting an environment variable named `JAVA_HOME`, which must
    point to the **JDK** (**Java Development Kit**) folder in your system. Check this
    environment variable to avoid future issues during the installation of Android
    Studio.

    Although Android Studio automatically installs the last Android SDK available,
    so you should already have everything you need to create your first application,
    it is important to check it and to learn how we can change it.

    Defaults** | **Project Structure**. In **Platform Settings**, click on **SDKs**.
    The list of the installed SDKs will be shown and you should have at least one
    Android SDK in the list. In **Project Settings**, click on **Project** to open
    the general settings for the project default template. You should have a selected
    **Project SDK** as shown in the next screenshot. This selected SDK is the default
    that will be used in our Android projects, but even so we can change it later
    for specific projects that require special settings.

    the options available in the welcome screen. We have also learned how to configure
    our Android SDK and how to install it manually in case you want to use a different
    version. Fulfilling these tasks will leave your system with Android Studio running
    and configured to create your first project.
