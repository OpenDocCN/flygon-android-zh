- en: Android Wear 2.0 is a powerful platform for wearable smart devices. Wear 2.0
    enabled close to 72 percent new device activation in the wearable device market
    from the day Wear was announced. Google is working with multiple iconic brands
    to bring the best user experience to smart watches. Continuous improvement in
    the Wear hardware for new devices in the market shows the potential Wear devices
    can offer. Google introduced a whole new way of experiencing wearable technology
    with material design, standalone applications, watch face innovations, and more.

- en: This book helps to create five Wear applications, with comprehensive explanations.
    We start with making a wearable note taking application by exploring Wear-specific
    user interface components and building a Wear map application with the ability
    to persist a quick note on the map. We will build a complete chat application
    with a companion mobile application. We will also build a health and fitness application
    to monitor pulse rate, a reminder to drink water, and so on, and also write a
    digital watch. We will complete the book by exploring the capabilities of the
    Wear 2.0 platform.
