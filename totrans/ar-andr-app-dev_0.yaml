- en: Augmented Reality offers the magic effect of blending the physical world with
    the virtual world and brings applications from your screen into your hands. Augmented
    Reality redefines advertising and gaming as well as education in an utterly new
    way; it will become a technology that needs to be mastered by mobile application
    developers. This book enables you to practically implement sensor-based and computer
    vision-based Augmented Reality applications on Android. Learn about the theoretical
    foundations and practical details of implemented Augmented Reality applications.
    Hands-on examples will enable you to quickly develop and deploy novel Augmented
    Reality applications on your own.

    next level of mobile app development using Augmented Reality, then this book is
    for you. It is assumed that you are familiar with Android development tools and
    deployment. It is beneficial if you have experience on working with external libraries
    for Android, as we make use of JMonkeyEngine and the Vuforia^(TM) SDK. If you
    have already used the Android N, this is great but not mandatory.
