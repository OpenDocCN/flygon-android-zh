    the paths to follow to go further. You now know the key elements to tame these
    little powerful monsters and start exploiting their full power. However, there
    is still a lot to learn, but the time and space is not enough. Anyway, the only
    way to master a technology is to practice and practice again. I hope you enjoy
    the journey and that you feel armed for the mobile challenge. So my best advice
    now is to gather your fresh knowledge and all your amazing ideas, beat them up
    in your mind, and bake them with your keyboard!

    at [http://source.android.com/](http://source.android.com/). It is not a piece
    of cake to download, compile, or even deploy, but this is the only way to get

    way to find out where these annoying bugs are coming from!

    is another. This is, of course, outside the scope of this book but handling fragmentation

- en: Beware! Problems start occurring when you start dealing with hardware specificities
    (and there are lots of them) like we saw with input devices. These issues are,
    however, not specific to the NDK. If incompatibilities exist in a Java application,
    then the native code will not do better. Handling various screen sizes, loading
    appropriately-sized resources, and adapting to device capabilities are things
    that you will eventually need to deal with. However, that should be manageable.

    However, Android and mobility are still a fallow land that needs to be modeled.
    Look at the evolution of Android from its earliest version to the latest one to
    be convinced. Revolution does not take place every day so do not miss it!
