- en: Long gone are the days of the mobile apps with a static UI squished onto a tiny
    screen. Today's users expect mobile apps to be dynamic and highly interactive.
    They expect an app to look fantastic when they're looking at it on their medium-resolution
    smartphone, and that same app needs to look just as fantastic when they switch
    over to using it on their high-resolution tablet. Apps need to provide rich navigation
    features. Also, apps need to be adaptive and responsive.

    UI design model is difficult. As developers, we need more control than that afforded
    by activities. We need a new approach: fragments give us that new approach.'

    dynamic UIs in the modern world of mobile app development.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Fragments and UI Modularization"), *Fragments
    and UI Modularization*, introduces fragments, UI modularization, and the role
    fragments play in developing a modularized UI. This chapter demonstrates the creation
    of simple fragments and using fragments statically within activities.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Fragments and UI Flexibility"), *Fragments
    and UI Flexibility*, builds on the concepts introduced in the previous chapter
    to provide solutions to specific differences in device layouts. This chapter explains
    how to use adaptive activity layout definitions to provide support for a wide
    variety of device form factors, with a small set of fragments that automatically
    rearrange based on the current device''s UI requirements.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Fragment Lifecycle and Specialization"),
    *Fragment Lifecycle and Specialization*, discusses the relationship of the lifecycle
    of fragments to that of activities, and demonstrates the appropriate programming
    actions at the various points in the lifecycle. Leveraging this knowledge, the
    special purpose fragment classes `ListFragment` and `DialogFragment` are introduced
    to demonstrate their behavior and provide a deeper understanding of how their
    behavior in the activity lifecycle differs from that of standard fragments.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Working with Fragment Transactions"), *Working
    with Fragment Transactions*, explains how to create multiple app screens within
    a single activity, by dynamically adding and removing fragments using fragment
    transactions. Topics covered include, implementing back button behavior and dynamically
    adapting multi-fragment UIs to differences in device characteristics.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Creating Rich Navigation with Fragments"),
    *Creating Rich Navigation with Fragments*, brings everything together by building
    on the previous chapters to show how to use fragments to enhance the user''s experience
    through rich navigation features. This chapter demonstrates how to implement a
    number of navigation features, including screen browsing with swipe-based paging,
    direct screen access with the drop-down list navigation, and random screen viewing
    with tabs.'
