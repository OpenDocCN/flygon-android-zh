    with GPIOs to receive digital input signals from the outside world and send digital
    output signals back in response. While this is a small start, it is the first
    step in developing and understanding hardware-interfacing apps that are much more
    complex. GPIOs can be used to implement complex and powerful interfacing logic.
    We will discuss both the hardware and software sides of GPIO interfacing and explain
    how calling Java methods in Android apps can interface with low-level hardware-interfacing
    code.'

    the transmission of data back and forth between them. In computer systems, this
    data is represented as voltage levels sent over a wire that connects the devices
    together. The patterns and levels of voltage back and forth form a communication
    protocol that the devices use to transmit data between each other.

    Some pins of the BBB's processor are allocated as GPIOs that act as an *input*
    (monitoring voltage on the wire to receive data) or an *output* (placing a particular
    voltage on the wire to send data). The BBB has dozens of available GPIO pins,
    which makes GPIO a flexible and simple way for Android apps to interact with the
    outside world without requiring fancy device drivers or extra interfacing hardware.

    that represent an *on/high* state and an *off/low* state. By toggling between
    these two states, binary bits of data are transmitted between devices. The BBB
    uses the voltage of 3.3 V for its high level and a voltage of 0 V (connected to
    a ground) for the low level. This voltage scheme is known as a *3.3 V logic level*,
    and it is commonly used for single-board computers such as the BeagleBoard and
    Raspberry Pi. Many microcontrollers (many Arduinos, for example) use a 5 V logic
    level instead.

    make sure that you only work with a maximum of 3.3 V when designing the GPIO interface
    circuitry for the BBB. Pins P9.3/4 supply 3.3 V, and pins P9.5/6 supply 5 V. It
    is very simple to accidentally connect a breadboard wire to the pins supplying
    5 V when you intended to use the 3.3 V pins. To help avoid this mistake, try covering
    the P9.5/6 pins with a piece of tape. This prevents you from accidentally inserting
    a breadboard wire into these pins.

    bank. With only 92 pins available on the P8/9 connectors, it is not possible to
    give every GPIO access to the outside world. In fact, the BBB's System Reference
    Manual shows that it is only possible to mux about 65 unique GPIOs to P8/P9 at
    the same time, even if every other feature being muxed to P8/9 was disabled. There
    are a few other GPIOs that are used internally for tasks such as lighting and
    blinking the BBB's LEDs, but you should consider yourself restricted to only using
    the GPIOs that are accessible via P8/P9 and that do not conflict with any of the
    standard BBB features.

    a kernel driver by reading and writing to GPIO files in the filesystem. With memory-mapping,
    you map the GPIO control resistors into memory and then read and write these mapped
    memory locations to directly manipulate the control resistors. As both of these

    For experimentation and prototyping, this is not a problem. However, you certainly
    should not do this in a commercial system. Unless you develop a proper, privileged
    Android manager to handle the GPIO resources, you must allow *all* processes to
    access the GPIO files unless you tailor the permissions to only be usable by apps
    belonging to a specific user or group. As each app is assigned its own user, you

    provides a set of interfacing functions that you will use to work with GPIOs from
    within your Android apps. These functions allow you to read the values of input
    GPIOs and set the values of output GPIOs. The low-level details of the hardware
    interfacing are implemented in PacktHAL, so you can quickly and easily get your

    then call one of the PacktHAL C functions, for example, `openGPIO()`, that actually

    method using `openGPIO()` function's `useMmap` parameter. The two methods are
    file I/O (by setting `useMmap` to 0) and memory-mapping (by setting `useMmap`
    to any non-zero number). To change from one interfacing method to the other, you
    must call `closeGPIO()` to shut down the GPIO portion of PacktHAL and then call
    `openGPIO()` again with a different value for `useMmap`.

    control resistors. As apps cannot run as root, the JNI wrapper function always

    I/O to interact with GPIOs. The `openGPIO()` method in the `MainActivity` class
