- en: Mobile applications have had a huge increase in popularity in the last few years
    and this interest is still growing among users. Mobile operating systems are available
    not only for smartphones but tablets as well, therefore increasing the possible
    market quota for these applications.

- en: Android has characteristics that make it pleasant to developers such as open
    source and a certain level of community-driven development. Android has always
    been contesting with iOS (the Apple mobile system) in everything and with XCode,
    iOS presented itself as a more centralized development environment. The new IDE
    Android Studio makes this centralization finally available for Android developers
    and makes this tool indispensable for a good Android developer.
