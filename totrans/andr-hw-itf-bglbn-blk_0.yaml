- en: 'The broad availability of Android-based devices has generated a large amount
    of interest in developing software applications, or apps, that target Android.
    Luckily, a powerful and low-cost hardware platform is available that allows you
    to quickly and easily test your apps on real hardware: the BeagleBone Black. With
    a focus on small size and a wide variety of expansion and interfacing opportunities,
    the BeagleBone Black provides a lot of processing power at a very low price. It
    also provides an opportunity to app developers that once belonged only to those
    that were expert hardware hackers or owners of expensive hardware development
    kits: the chance to write Android apps that interact with custom hardware circuits.'

- en: Whether you are brand new to hardware interfacing or a seasoned expert, *Android
    for the BeagleBone Black* provides you with the tools that you need to begin creating
    Android apps that communicate directly with your custom hardware. From the very
    beginning, this book will help you understand Android's unique approach to hardware
    interfacing. You will install and customize Android, build circuits that interface
    with your BeagleBone Black platform, and build native code and Android apps that
    use that hardware to communicate with the outside world. By sequentially working
    through the examples in each chapter, you will learn how to create multithreaded
    apps that are capable of interfacing with multiple hardware components simultaneously.

    you will be well on your way toward becoming an Android hardware interfacing pro!

    walks you through the process of installing the Android OS to your BeagleBone
    Black board. It also provides you with a list of hardware components that you
    will need to perform the activities throughout this book.'

    *Interfacing with Android*, introduces you to several aspects of the BeagleBone
    Black''s hardware and Android''s Hardware Abstraction Layer. It describes how
    to make a few modifications to both your development environment and Android installed
    on your BeagleBone Black to allow Android apps to access the various hardware
    features of the BeagleBone Black.'

    your very first hardware interfacing circuit and explains the details of a basic
    Android app that can communicate with it. This is your first step toward building
    much more complex apps that interact with the world outside your BeagleBone Black.'

    Outputs with GPIOs"), *Handling Inputs and Outputs with GPIOs*, and explains how
    asynchronous background threads within your apps are used to communicate with
    hardware. It guides you through building a circuit that interfaces a nonvolatile
    memory chip to the BeagleBone Black and the implementation details of an app that
    interacts with the chip.'

- en: We have provided instructions in this book assuming that you are using either
    a Windows- or Linux-based computer. If you are already an Android app developer,
    you probably have all of the software applications that you need already installed.
    We expect you to have both the Eclipse ADT and Android NDK already installed,
    though we provide links to download these tools at the start of [Chapter 2](part0019_split_000.html#page
    "Chapter 2. Interfacing with Android"), *Interfacing with Android*, in the event
    that you do not already have them. [Chapter 1](part0014_split_000.html#page "Chapter 1. Introduction
    to Android and the BeagleBone Black"), *Introduction to Android and the BeagleBone
    Black*, provides a list of the various hardware components and equipment that
    you will need to implement the example interfacing circuits used throughout the
    book.

    hardware capabilities of the BeagleBone Black platform, then this book is ideal
    for you. Having familiarity with basic electronics principles is helpful, and
    the reader is expected to have basic knowledge in developing Android apps with
    the Eclipse ADT and Android SDK, but no prior hardware experience is required.
