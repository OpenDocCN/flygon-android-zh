- en: Cocos2d-x is the most used open source game framework. It has official support
    from Microsoft for their mobile and desktop platform, and its small core runs
    faster than other frameworks, allowing it to run on low-end Android devices with
    outstanding performance. It is currently maintained by an active open source development
    community led by the author of the original Cocos2d for iPhone and Chukong Technologies.

- en: This introductory book will guide you through the steps for creating a simple
    two-dimensional game for Android from scratch. During this journey, you will learn
    the fundamentals of the Cocos2d-x C++ multiplatform game framework and how to
    handle sprites, add physics to your games, play sounds, display text, generate
    realistic explosions using particle systems, and add native Android functionalities
    using Java Native Interface (JNI).

    Game Physics*, demonstrates the basics of the new Cocos2d-x physics engine based
    on Chipmunk, which was introduced in Cocos2d-x version 3.0\. We will create physics-based
    bodies, add gravity to them, and detect collisions.'

    interaction to our game, allowing it to interact with the user with the help of
    touch listeners and the accelerometer.'

    and Fonts*, proves that handling text is crucial for game development. Irrespective
    of the complexity of your game, the odds are that you will display information,
    sometimes with foreign character sets. This chapter shows you how to use simple
    true-type fonts and more stylized bitmap fonts to make your game look more professional.'

    emotion of playing a game comes from the music and sound effects. Within this
    chapter, you learn how to add background music and sound effects to your game
    using the CocosDenshion audio engine, which has been present since the original
    Cocos2d iPhone game engine. This chapter also covers how to play media using the
    new audio engine and highlights the major differences between them.'

    Systems*, illustrates the creation of realistic explosions, fire, snow, rain using
    the built-in particle systems engine. This chapter shows you how to create your
    own particle system when you require a customized effect, using the most popular
    tools.'

    Android-specific behavior from within your Cocos2d-x game activity. We do this
    using the Java Native Interface (JNI) mechanism, available on the Android platform.'
