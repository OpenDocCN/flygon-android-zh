- en: 'This book is a sequel to *Android NDK Game Development Cookbook, Packt Publishing,*
    published in 2013\. It covers NDK development from quite an unusual point of view:
    building your mobile C++ applications in a portable way so that they can be developed
    and debugged on a desktop computer. This approach greatly reduces iteration and
    content integration time and is essential in the world of professional mobile
    software development.'

    *Using Command-line Tools*, shows you how to install and configure the essential
    tools for Android native development using the command line and how to write basic
    Android application configuration files manually from scratch without falling
    back on the graphical IDEs.'

    Libraries*, shows you how to build popular C/C++ libraries and link them against
    your applications using the Android NDK. These libraries are the building blocks
    to implement feature-rich applications with images, videos, sounds, and networking
    entirely in C++. We will show you how to compile libraries and, of course, give
    some examples and hints on how to start using them. Some of the libraries are
    discussed in greater detail in the subsequent chapters.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](part0035.xhtml#aid-11C3M2 "Chapter 3. Networking"), *Networking*,
    focuses on how to deal with network-related functionality from the native C/C++
    code. Networking tasks are asynchronous by nature and unpredictable in terms of
    timing. Even when the underlying connection is established using the TCP protocol,
    there is no guarantee on the delivery time, and nothing prevents the applications
    from freezing while waiting for the data. We will take a closer look at implementing
    basic asynchronous mechanisms in a portable way.'

    *Organizing a Virtual Filesystem*, implements low-level abstractions to deal with
    the OS-independent access to files and filesystems. We will show how to implement
    portable and transparent access to the Android assets packed inside the `.apk`
    files without falling back on any built-in APIs. This approach is necessary when
    building multiplatform applications that are debuggable in a desktop environment.'

    *Cross-platform Audio Streaming*, implements a truly portable audio subsystem
    for Android and desktop PCs based on the OpenAL library. The code makes use of
    the multithreading material from [Chapter 3](part0035.xhtml#aid-11C3M2 "Chapter 3. Networking"),
    *Networking*.'

    applications runnable on Android and desktop machines.'

    to render geometric primitives and Unicode text. The second part of the chapter
    describes a multi-page graphical user interface suitable for being the cornerstone
    for building the interfaces of multiplatform applications. This chapter concludes
    with an SDL application, which demonstrates the capabilities of our UI system
    in action.'

    begins with an implementation of the Boids algorithm and then proceeds with the
